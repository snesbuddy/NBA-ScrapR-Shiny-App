There are 2 R scripts for this:

GetData.R which uses the NBAScrapR library developed by abresler to scrape the data for this shiny app
app.R which transforms and displays the data using Shiny

this app can be seen in browser at snesbuddy.shinyapps.io/NBAScrapR

Special thanks to abresler for developing NBAScrapR and teamcolorcodes.com for gathering and sharing all team color schemes used in this app.
